=============================================================

	This folder contains both the portable .EXE and the .SED file. You can run the ClipClear.exe without anything else on your machine. It will run the ClipClear.bat hidden.
	The .SED file cand be edited and used in conjunction with iexpress and ClipClear.bat to create a custom ClipClear.exe
